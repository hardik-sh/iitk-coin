# Task 1
1. Create a private GitHub repository. This is where all the code will reside. Keep the name of your repo as iitk-coin. Add me (bhuvansingla) as a collaborator.

2. Set up your local Go project. You must have read that in Go conventionally you keep all the code at $GOPATH/src. You should be following that convention. Ideally, your code will be residing at $GOPATH/src/github.com/yourusername/iitk-coin/. Initialize your Go module.

3. Write a program that connects to a database. The database that we will be working with is SQLite. On executing the program it should create a new table (say, User with two fields rollno and name). Create a function that takes in new user details as arguments and adds it to the database. Your program should not take any input from command line. Aim to write clean and structured code.
